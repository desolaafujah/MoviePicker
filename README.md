# MoviePicker
This would be a tool utilized by me and my friends when we want to watch a movie and have no clue on what to watch.


Users would be able to pick from categories such as genre, age restrictions, streaming services they prefer, etc




This project is my first real attempt at building a machine learning project. I'm excited for the journey and the future where I can build projects that create real impacts.
